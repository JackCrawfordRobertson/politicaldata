For more, see [the package's project file on my blog]() or [view the vignettes](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-election-and-polling-data-in-r). You can see how many of these data are used in the real world via my interactive R course at DataCamp.com, ["Analyzing Election and Polling Data in R"](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-election-and-polling-data-in-r)



# Installation

The politicaldata package is not yet available from CRAN.

To get the current development version from GitHub:

```
## install the remotes package if it's not already
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

## install dev version of rtweet from github
remotes::install_github("elliottmorris/politicaldata")

## load rtweet package
library(politicaldata)
```


# Usage

_Constantly updating..._ 

## A list of functions:

- `get_house_nominate()` returns [DW-NOMINATE](https://www.voteview.com/about) ideology scores for each member of the U.S. House of Representatives for a specified congress, else every Representative ever.
- `get_senate_nominate()` returns [DW-NOMINATE](https://www.voteview.com/about) ideology scores for each member of the U.S. Senate for a specified congress, else every Senator ever.

## A list of data:

- `house_116` is a saved copy of the output from `get_house_nominate(congress=116)` run on the last day the package was updated (and thus should only be used for demos, unless you want outdated data).
- `senate_116` is the same as the above, bur for the Senate. Downloaded via `get_senate_nominate(congress=116)`.
- `us_polls_history` a dataset of US presidential election polling from the 1980 through 2016 elections.



# Vignettes



# Suggested related packages:

- `Rvoteview` provides functions for obtaining roll call voting data, which can thus be analyzed using algorithms from the `pscl` package.
- `ropercenter` allows you import data from the Roper Center's iPoll directly in R, given that you know the slug of the interested poll.
- `fivethirtyeight` was developed to distribute the data behind the popular "data journalism" website, and thus will have some overlap. FiveThirtyEight also releases most of their data [on GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data).
- `pollstR` provides a way to access the aggregate toplines from Huffington Post Pollster, which is sadly no longer being updated.
